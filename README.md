# Three-Body-Lunar-Simulation-and-Comparison
A high-precision three-body orbital simulation of the Earth-Moon system. This project compares Analytical (Kepler + Bisection), Numerical (Velocity Verlet), and Optimized (Gradient Descent with the previous methods) models, validated against NASA JPL ephemeris data using IAU physical constants for accurate eclipse prediction.
